Task: Implement SHA-256 password hashing (simple, clean).

Progress: I implemented a hashing function for the passwords. It was quite simple
and easy to do. I had to install a libray called bcrypt that uses the gensalt function
to salt the password and the hashpw function to hash the password.

Challenges: I would say the hardest challenge was understanding what the bcrypt library
provies and understanding how to use the fucntions, in order to achieve the object of the 
project.

Task: Implement a dictionary attack against bcrypt hashes (educational, limited, safe).

Progress: I implemented a mock dicitonary attack to simulate a real-world scenario. I started
off by creating the fucntion to hash the user's password. I then made another function to “crack” 
a bcrypt‑hashed password by performing a dictionary attack. 

Challenges: The challenges I faced for this task were creating the functions and implemneting the
hashing and cracking logic within the functions. It was a bit difficult to know what needed to be 
passed within the arguments. I spent a bit of time debugging to understand what is needed in the 
program.
